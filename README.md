## Overview

[USBTMC][] is a USB device class specification for test equiment and
instrumentation devices, such as oscilloscopes, digital multimeters, and
function generators. USBTMC requires three endpoints:

- Control endpoint
- Bulk-OUT endpoint
- Bulk-IN endpoint

Additionally, the USBTMC subclass USB488 has an Interrupt-IN endpoint.

## USBTMC Descriptors

- Interface class = 0xFE (application-specific)
- Interface subclass = 0x03 (indicates USBTMC)

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/gotmc/usbtmc
```

## Usage

To use the [usbtmc][gousbtmc] package, you must register which Go-based
[libusb][] interface library should be used.  [libusb][] is "a C library
that provides generic access to USB devices." There are two Go-based
libusb hardware interface libraries available:

- [github.com/google/gousb][gousb]
- [github.com/gotmc/libusb][golibusb] â€” Not working currently

You'll need to install ***one*** of the above libraries using:

```bash
$ go get -v github.com/google/gousb
$ go get -v github.com/gotmc/gotmc
```

To indicate which libusb interface library should be used, include
***one*** of the following blank imports:

```go
import _ "github.com/gotmc/usbtmc/driver/google"
import _ "github.com/gotmc/usbtmc/driver/gotmc"
```
