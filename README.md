## Overview

[USBTMC][] is a USB device class specification for test equiment and
instrumentation devices, such as oscilloscopes, digital multimeters, and
function generators. USBTMC requires three endpoints:

- Control endpoint
- Bulk-OUT endpoint
- Bulk-IN endpoint

Additionally, the USBTMC subclass USB488 has an Interrupt-IN endpoint.

This packages enables controlling USBTMC compatible test equipment (e.g.,
oscilloscopes, function generators, multimeters, etc.) over USB. While this
package can be used by itself to send Standard Commands for Programmable
Instruments ([SCPI][]) commands to a piece of test equipment, it also serves to
provide an Instrument interface for both the [ivi][] and [visa][] packages. The
[ivi][] package provides standardized APIs for programming test instruments
following the [Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) standard][ivi-specs].

## USBTMC Descriptors

- Interface class = 0xFE (application-specific)
- Interface subclass = 0x03 (indicates USBTMC)

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/gotmc/usbtmc
```

## Usage

To use the [usbtmc][gousbtmc] package, you must register which Go-based
[libusb][] interface library should be used. [libusb][] is "a C library
that provides generic access to USB devices." There are two Go-based
libusb hardware interface libraries available:

- [github.com/google/gousb][gousb]
- [github.com/gotmc/libusb][golibusb] â€” Not working currently

You'll need to install **_one_** of the above libraries using:

```bash
$ go get -v github.com/google/gousb
$ go get -v github.com/gotmc/gotmc
```

To indicate which libusb interface library should be used, include
**_one_** of the following blank imports:

```go
import _ "github.com/gotmc/usbtmc/driver/google"
import _ "github.com/gotmc/usbtmc/driver/gotmc"
```
